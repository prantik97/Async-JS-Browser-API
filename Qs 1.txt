 Ql. Define XMLHttpRequest object, and How is it used in AJAX?

 1. ANS: The XMLHttpRequest object is a core component of AJAX (Asynchronous JavaScript 
 and XML), a technique used in web development to send and receive data asynchronously 
 between a web browser and a web server without refreshing the page. 


 2. ANS: Usage in AJAX:
   - In an AJAX application, JavaScript code uses the `XMLHttpRequest` object to send 
    requests to a server in the background, without interfering with the user's 
    interaction with the web page.
   - Typically, an `XMLHttpRequest` object is created using its constructor function 
     `XMLHttpRequest()`.
   - After creating the object, you can configure it by setting various properties such as 
     the request method (`GET`, `POST`, etc.), request URL, headers, and payload 
     (if applicable).
   - Once configured, you initiate the request using the `open()` method followed by 
     the `send()` method.
   - You can optionally define event listeners to handle different stages of the 
     request-response cycle, such as `onload` to handle successful responses, 
     `onerror` to handle errors, etc.
   - Upon receiving a response from the server, the `XMLHttpRequest` object processes 
     the response, and you can access the response data through its properties such 
    as `responseText`, `responseXML`, or `response`.
