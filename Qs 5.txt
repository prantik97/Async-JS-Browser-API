Question. List and briefly explain some common Browser APIs available to JavaScript developers.

ANS: Browser APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) provide JavaScript developers 
with access to various functionalities and features of web browsers. Here are some 
common Browser APIs along with brief explanations:

DOM (Document Object Model):
The DOM API allows JavaScript to interact with the structure of HTML and XML documents. 
It provides methods and properties to dynamically access, modify, and manipulate the 
content and structure of web pages.

Fetch API:
The Fetch API provides an interface for fetching resources 
(such as JSON data, text, or files) across the network. It offers a more flexible and 
powerful way to make HTTP requests compared to older techniques like XMLHttpRequest.

Geolocation API:
The Geolocation API allows web applications to access the user's geographical 
location information. Developers can use this API to retrieve the device's current 
position, track movement, and provide location-based services.

Web Storage API:
The Web Storage API enables web applications to store data locally within the user's 
browser. It includes both localStorage and sessionStorage, which provide mechanisms for 
storing key-value pairs persistently or temporarily, respectively.

WebRTC (Web Real-Time Communication):
WebRTC enables peer-to-peer communication in web browsers, allowing direct audio, video, 
and data streaming between users. It eliminates the need for plugins or third-party 
software, making real-time communication applications (such as video conferencing and 
file sharing) feasible on the web.

WebSockets:
WebSockets provide a persistent, full-duplex communication channel between a 
client (typically a web browser) and a server. This enables real-time, bidirectional 
data exchange, making it suitable for applications requiring low-latency communication, 
such as chat applications and online gaming.
